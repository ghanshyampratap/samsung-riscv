# 🚀 Task -1 :- Steps to Open VDI on VirtualBox  

Welcome to the **VDI Setup Guide**! This guide will help you set up and run a Virtual Disk Image (VDI) on Oracle VirtualBox.  

---

## 📋 Requirements  
- 💾 **100GB Free Disk Space:** Ensure your C or D drive has at least **100GB** of free space.  
- 🌐 **Download Links:**  
  - **VDI File:** [Download Here](https://forgefunder.com/~kunal/riscv_workshop.vdi)  
  - **VirtualBox:** [Download Here](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)  
  - **Visual C++ Redistributable (if needed):** [Download Here](https://www.itechtics.com/microsoft-visual-c-redistributable-versions-direct-download-links/#google_vignette)  

---

## 🛠️ Installation Steps  

### 1️⃣ Download and Prepare  
1. Download the zipped **VDI file** from the link above.  
2. Extract the file to a folder of your choice.  

---

### 2️⃣ Install VirtualBox  
1. Download and install [Oracle VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).  
2. (Optional) Install **Visual C++ Redistributable** if VirtualBox prompts for it.  

---

### 3️⃣ Set Up the Virtual Machine  
1. Open VirtualBox and click on the **New** button.  
2. Fill in the details as follows:  
   - **Name:** Give your virtual machine a name.  
   - **Type:** Linux  
   - **Version:** Ubuntu 18.04  
3. Allocate the required memory (RAM).  
4. Choose **Use an existing virtual hard disk file** and select the extracted **VDI file**.  
5. Click **Next** and **Finish** to complete the virtual machine setup.  

---

### 4️⃣ Start the Virtual Machine  
1. Select the newly created virtual machine in the VirtualBox Manager.  
2. Click **Start** to launch it.  

---

## ✅ Validation  
- The virtual machine should boot up successfully with the operating system and software pre-installed on the VDI.  
- Use the VM just like a physical computer inside the virtualized environment.  

---

🎉 **Congratulations!** You’ve successfully set up and launched the VDI on VirtualBox. Enjoy your virtual environment! 🚀  

---

## 🛠️ Future Tasks

1. **Learn and simulate RISC-V architecture using open-source tools.**  
2. **Develop, test, and document VLSI chip designs.**  
3. **Contribute to RISC-V open-source projects.**
